## Project Disclaimer 🚧

  This project drew inspiration from the ["Chester Portfolio" template](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/chester-react-personal-portfolio-template/full_screen_preview/24952954) on Envato. The design was recreated independently due to budget constraints preventing the purchase of the $12 template. While visually influenced by the original design, no code was directly copied.
